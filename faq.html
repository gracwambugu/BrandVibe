            <summary>What is brand strategy?</summary>
            <p class="muted">
              Brand strategy is a comprehensive plan that defines how your business communicates its
              unique value to customers. It includes your mission, vision, positioning, messaging,
              and visual identity. A strong brand strategy helps you stand out from competitors and
              build lasting customer relationships.

          <details>
            <summary>Why do I need a brand audit?</summary>
            <p class="muted">
              A brand audit evaluates your current brand positioning, messaging, visual identity,
              and market perception. It identifies strengths to leverage, gaps to address, and
              opportunities for growth—helping you make informed decisions about brand evolution.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What is brand positioning?</summary>
            <p class="muted">
              Brand positioning defines how you want your target audience to perceive your business
              relative to competitors. It clarifies your unique value proposition, target market,
              and key differentiators so customers understand why they should choose you.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>How long does a brand strategy project take?</summary>
            <p class="muted">
              A typical brand strategy project takes 6–12 weeks, depending on complexity and scope.
              This includes discovery, analysis, strategy development, and implementation planning.
              We work closely with you throughout the process to ensure alignment with your goals.

        <div class="faq-group">
          <h3 class="faq-heading">Digital Marketing</h3>

          <details>
            <summary>What is content marketing?</summary>
            <p class="muted">
              Content marketing involves creating and sharing valuable, relevant content to attract
              and engage your target audience. This includes blog posts, videos, infographics,
              podcasts, and more. Effective content marketing builds trust, establishes authority,
              and drives organic traffic.

          <details>
            <summary>What is SEO and why does it matter?</summary>
            <p class="muted">
              SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the practice of optimizing your website to rank
              higher in search engine results. It matters because most online experiences begin
              with a search engine, and higher rankings drive more organic traffic, leads, and revenue.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>How do I measure marketing ROI?</summary>
            <p class="muted">
              Marketing ROI is calculated by dividing the profit generated from marketing efforts
              by the total marketing investment, then multiplying by 100. Key metrics include
              customer acquisition cost (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), conversion rates, and return
              on ad spend (ROAS). Analytics tools help track these metrics consistently.

          <details>
            <summary>How often should I post on social media?</summary>
            <p class="muted">
              Posting frequency depends on your platform and audience. Generally:
              3–5 times weekly on Instagram, 1–2 times daily on LinkedIn, and 5–10 times daily on X
              (Twitter). Focus on consistency and quality, and monitor engagement to refine your schedule.
